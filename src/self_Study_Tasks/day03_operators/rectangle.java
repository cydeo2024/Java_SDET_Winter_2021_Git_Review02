/*Create a class named day07_practice_tasks.Rectangle with the following variables:
					length
					width

	Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of the given rectangle.

					Example:
						length = 4.5
						width = 2

					Output:
						The area of the rectangle is 9.0
						The perimeter of the rectangle is 13.0

			Hint:
				Area of rectangle:
					area=length×width

				Perimeter of rectangle:
					perimeter=2×(length+width)
